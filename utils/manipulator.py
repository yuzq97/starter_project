  Basically, this function takes a latent code and a boundary as inputs, and
  outputs a collection of manipulated latent codes. For example, let `steps` to
  be 10, then the input `latent_code` is with shape [1, latent_space_dim], input
  `boundary` is with shape [1, latent_space_dim] and unit norm, the output is
  with shape [10, latent_space_dim]. The first output latent code is
  `start_distance` away from the given `boundary`, while the last output latent
  code is `end_distance` away from the given `boundary`. Remaining latent codes
  are linearly interpolated.

  Input `latent_code` can also be with shape [1, num_layers, latent_space_dim]
  to support W+ space in Style GAN. In this case, all features in W+ space will
  be manipulated same as each other. Accordingly, the output will be with shape
  [10, num_layers, latent_space_dim].

  NOTE: Distance is sign sensitive.

    start_distance: The distance to the boundary where the manipulation starts.

    end_distance: The distance to the boundary where the manipulation ends.
